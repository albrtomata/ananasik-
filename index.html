                <h2 id="about">ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>I am Anastasiia Ananieva, a Ukrainian artist born and raised in Zaporizhia but now based in Hobart - Tasmania. From my early years, I started to explore drawing. However, like most kids who love art, the preconceptions from this society pushed me to put my passion for art in a box and look for a "real profession", said my family. I studied accounting, got a Master's Degree in Accounting and Audit, and started a typical job. However, I wasn't happy, so when I turned 25 years made the difficult decision to leave my "real profession" and start my adventure in the artistic world. It was terrifying, but I was fortunate because I had the opportunity of meeting one of the finest Ukrainian artists who started to be my mentor. After years of this decision and many situations that have changed my life,  I am in Australia, escaping from the war and starting a new life far from my family and friends. 

                    <br><br>My dream is to touch with my art many people and grow as an artist. In my work, nature is an essential source of inspiration. I try to translate quotidian situations into my canvas, using imagination and mixed techniques. 
                    
                    <br><br>Thank you for visiting my website, and hope you find my work interesting.</p>
